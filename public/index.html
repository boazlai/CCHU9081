          <h2>Tour Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to "The HKU Urban Legend Walking Tour: Echo of the Past," a
            1.5-hour walking tour which walks the thin line between reality and
            make-believe at the University of Hong Kong. This walking tour of
            HKU's main campus shows how urban legends emerge from specific
            historical contexts, reflect student anxieties, and become part of
            the university's unofficial but lively folklore. Special for
            freshmen, the tour helps you explore both the landscape and
            unofficial histories of your new learning environment.

              Taking the elevator from the HKU station exit A2, you will arrive at the Haking Wong Building (G/f).
              By taking the elevator to the 5th floor, you will come accross the first urban legend of the tour.

            <h3>Background Facts</h3>
            <p>
              Before the HKU MTR station opened in 2014, this building served as
              a crucial gateway for students arriving by bus. The elevators
              provided access to the Haking Podium that connects to the U-street
              and other campus buildings.

            <h3>The Legends</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A student riding alone at midnight found the elevator stopping
                between 4th and 5th floors, revealing the word "DEAD" scrawled in blood-red
                on the elevator shaft
              </li>
              <li>
                Another student riding the elevator alone asked a figure standing outside 4th floor,
                "Do you want to come
                in?" only to receive the reply: "The lift is full. How can I get
                in?"
              </li>
              <li>
                The third student taking the elevator at night found the lift opened revealing four individuals standing in the corners, all
                with their backs turned
              </li>

              These stories likely emerged from the stress of late-night
              studying and the eerie atmosphere of empty campus spaces,
              transforming functional elevators into vessels for collective
              student anxiety.

              This corridor connecting the 4th floor of Haking Wong Building to
              James Lee Science Building was once a bustling student
              thoroughfare, now less traveled since the MTR station provided
              alternative routes.

              After 10 p.m., a student tapped a figure facing a locker, assuming
              it was a classmate. Upon turning, the person realized they were
              looking at their own reflection.

              Centennial Campus in 2012, it was refurbished into classrooms and

              The bridge connects Knowles Building's 5th floor to the old Main
              Library wing. "Happy Park" (Sun Yat-sen Place) below was the
              library's sole entrance before 2014 and earned its nickname as a
              social gathering spot.
