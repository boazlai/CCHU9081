## The Checkpoints

### 1. Haking Wong Building – The Mysterious Elevators
**Background Facts:** Before the HKU MTR station opened in 2014, this building served as a crucial gateway for students arriving by bus. The elevators provided access to the Haking Podium and connecting corridors to other campus buildings.

**The Legends:** 
- A student riding alone at midnight found the elevator stopping between floors, revealing the word "DEAD" scrawled in blood-red on the elevator shaft
- Another student asked a figure outside, "Do you want to come in?" only to receive the reply: "The lift is full. How can I get in?"
- A third encountered four figures standing in the corners, all with their backs turned

**Modern Interpretation:** These stories likely emerged from the stress of late-night studying and the eerie atmosphere of empty campus spaces, transforming functional elevators into vessels for collective student anxiety.

### 2. The Time Tunnel
**Background Facts:** This corridor connecting the 4th floor of Haking Wong Building to James Lee Science Building was once a bustling student thoroughfare, now less traveled since the MTR station provided alternative routes.

**The Legend:** After 10 p.m., a student tapped a figure facing a locker, assuming it was a classmate. Upon turning, the person realized they were looking at their own reflection.

**Modern Interpretation:** This story speaks to disorientation and identity confusion—common experiences for students adjusting to university life in a new environment.

### 3. The Main Building – History and Omens
**Background Facts:** As HKU's historic core, this building features architectural elements some attribute to Freemason influences among the university's founding patrons. After the Faculty of Arts moved to Centennial Campus in 2012, it was refurbished into classrooms and offices.

**The Legends:**
- The dragon door handle of Loke Yew Hall is said to prevent graduation if touched
- A girl may appear sitting on the lockers during midnight visits
- Architectural patterns supposedly contain hidden numerical significance

**Modern Interpretation:** These "luck-based" rituals embody graduation anxiety, creating tangible rules that help students navigate academic uncertainties through shared superstitions.

### 4. The "Haunted Bridge" & Happy Park
**Background Facts:** The bridge connects Knowles Building's 5th floor to the old Main Library wing. "Happy Park" (Sun Yat-sen Place) below was the library's sole entrance before 2014 and earned its nickname as a social gathering spot.

**The Legend:** A student, devastated by exam failure, allegedly jumped from Knowles Building's roof. Her head was severed by an open bridge window, with her body landing in Happy Park. Late-night witnesses reportedly see a floating female head at the bridge window.

**Modern Interpretation:** This powerful cautionary tale directly links academic pressure with tragic consequences, forcing important conversations about student well-being and support systems.

### 5. Knowles Building – The Key-Keeper's Lament
**Background Facts:** Built in 1973 as HKU's tallest building and first with elevators, it houses the Faculty of Architecture. Its complex layout and all-night studio culture contribute to its legendary status.

**The Legends of the Key-Keeper:**
- An old key-keeper, having lost his master key, now patrols asking students: "Have you seen my key?"
- Those who ignore him find themselves followed until they offer any key
- One student found the old man inside his locker after giving him the key
- Architecture freshmen received wooden spoons to offer the key-keeper if approached

**Modern Interpretation:** This legend personifies the intense pressure of architecture studio culture, where keys represent access, responsibility, and the fear of losing control over one's work and environment.
