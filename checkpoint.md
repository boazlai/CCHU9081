## The Checkpoints

### 1. Haking Wong Building – The Mysterious Elevators (5-10 mins)

**Route:** Taking the elevator from the HKU station exit A1, you will arrive at the Haking Wong Building (G/f). By taking the elevator to the 5th floor, you will come across the first urban legend of the tour.

**Background Facts:** Before the HKU MTR station opened in 2014, this building served as a crucial gateway for students arriving by bus. The elevators provided access to the Haking Podium that connects to the U-street and other campus buildings.

**The Legends:**

- A student riding alone at midnight found the elevator stopping between 4th and 5th floors, revealing the word "DEAD" scrawled in blood-red on the elevator shaft.
- Another student riding the elevator alone asked a figure standing outside 4th floor, "Do you want to come in?" only to receive the reply: "The lift is full. How can I get in?"
- The third student taking the elevator at night found the lift opened revealing four individuals standing in the corners, all with their backs turned.

**Modern Interpretation:** These stories likely emerged from the stress of late-night studying and the eerie atmosphere of empty campus spaces, transforming functional elevators into vessels for collective student anxiety.

### 2. The Time Tunnel (5-10 mins)

**Route:** Once you arrived 5th floor of Haking Wong Building, head back down to the 4th floor and walk through the second checkpoint "Time Tunnel" connecting to James Lee Science Building.

**Background Facts:** This corridor connecting the 4th floor of Haking Wong Building to James Lee Science Building was once a common location for students to travel around the campus, but now less being used since the MTR station provided alternative routes.

**The Legend:** A student walking through this corridor after 10 p.m. tapped a figure facing a locker, assuming it was a classmate. Upon turning, the student realized the figure was not a classmate, but the student's own reflection. Therefore, the corridor is named "Time Tunnel," as the student travels through time encountering their past self.

### 3. Knowles Building – The Key-Keeper's Lament (30 mins)

**Route:** After exiting the Time Tunnel, head down the stairs and walk towards the Knowles Building, the next checkpoint of the tour.

**Background Facts:** Built in 1973 as HKU's tallest building and first with elevators, it houses the Faculty of Architecture. Its complex layout and all-night studio culture contribute to its legendary status.

**The Legends of the Key-Keeper:**

- An old key-keeper who committed suicide because of losing a key, now patrols asking students: "Have you seen my key?" Those who ignore him find themselves followed until they offer any key.
- A student gave his own home key to the old key-keeper but days after, the old key-keeper returned it, saying "This isn't my key. Where is mine?"
- One student found the old man inside his locker after giving him his own locker key.
- Architecture freshmen were given wooden spoons to offer the key-keeper if approached during Architecture Society orientation.

**Modern Interpretation:** This legend personifies the intense pressure of architecture studio culture, where keys represent access, responsibility, and the fear of losing control over one's work and environment.

### 4. The "Haunted Bridge"

**Route:** After exploring Knowles Building, walk towards the bridge on the 5th floor connecting to the old Main Library wing. This bridge is the site of the next urban legend.

**Background Facts:** The bridge connects Knowles Building's 5th floor to the old Main Library wing. However, it is rarely used by students today.

**The Legends:**

- A student, devastated by failing a test, allegedly jumped off the roof of the Knowles Building. Her body fell into Happy Park after her head was cut off by an open bridge window. Late-night observers claim to have seen a female head floating near the bridge window.
- Her bloodstain remained on the bridge floor after her death, and the cleaning crew was unable to get rid of it, thus the interior of the bridge was painted red.
- After the incident, the bridge was sealed off with Taoist Fu (charms) on both sides.

**Modern Interpretation:** This Legend derives from academic stress and mental health struggles of students, especially when this Legend located between the home of Architecture students and the old Main Library wing, both gathering places for students facing high academic pressures.

_Note: No record of suicide incident found in official sources. Please visit [CoPE, CEDARS](https://www.cedars.hku.hk/cope/cps) for counselling and psychological support._

### 5. The Main Building – History and Omens

**Route:** Finally, walk towards the Main Building through library extension to explore the final urban legend of the tour.

**Background Facts:** As HKU's historic core, this building is the oldest building in HKU, completed in 1912. After the Faculty of Arts moved to Centennial Campus in 2012, it was refurbished into classrooms and offices.

**The Legends:**

- The dragon door handle of Loke Yew Hall is said to prevent graduation if touched
- A girl may appear sitting on the lockers during midnight visits
- Architectural patterns like the number of staircases and room sizes that align with the number 3, believed to linked to Freemason influences among HKU's founding patrons.

**Modern Interpretation:** These "luck-based" rituals embody graduation anxiety, creating tangible rules that help students navigate academic uncertainties through shared superstitions. Additionally, the main building's long history and contrasting architectural design against modern campus buildings make it a fitting site for legends blending tradition and student folklore.
