          <h2>Tour Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to "The HKU Urban Legend Walking Tour: Echo of the Past," a
            ~70 mins walking tour which walks the thin line between reality and
            make-believe at the University of Hong Kong. This walking tour of
            HKU's main campus shows how urban legends emerge from specific
            historical contexts, reflect student anxieties, and become part of
            the university's unofficial but lively folklore. Special for
            freshmen, the tour helps you explore both the landscape and
            unofficial histories of your new learning environment.

        <p class="tour-intro slide-in">
          This self-guided walking tour takes you through five iconic HKU
          locations where campus urban legends come alive. You'll discover how
          urban legends reflect the real anxieties, pressures, and experiences
          of university life. Unlike typical campus tours that focus solely on
          architecture and history, this journey reveals the
          <strong>hidden emotional landscape</strong> of HKU through the stories
          students tell each other.

            <p>
              Taking the elevator from the HKU station exit A1, you will arrive
              at the Haking Wong Building (G/f). By taking the elevator to the
              5th floor, you will come accross the first urban legend of the
              tour.

            <h3>Background Facts</h3>
            <p>
              Before the HKU MTR station opened in 2014, this building served as
              a crucial gateway for students arriving by bus. The elevators
              provided access to the Haking Podium that connects to the U-street
              and other campus buildings.

          <div class="checkpoint-section slide-in">
            <h3>The Legends</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A student riding alone at midnight found the elevator stopping
                between 4th and 5th floors, revealing the word "DEAD" scrawled
                in blood-red on the elevator shaft.
              </li>
              <li>
                Another student riding the elevator alone asked a figure
                standing outside 4th floor, "Do you want to come in?" only to
                receive the reply: "The lift is full. How can I get in?"
              </li>
              <li>
                The third student taking the elevator at night found the lift
                opened revealing four individuals standing in the corners, all
                with their backs turned.
              </li>

          <div class="checkpoint-section slide-in">
            <h3>Modern Interpretation</h3>
            <p>
              These stories likely emerged from the stress of late-night
              studying and the eerie atmosphere of empty campus spaces,
              transforming functional elevators into vessels for collective
              student anxiety.

              Once you arrived 5th floor of Haking Wong Building, head back down
              to the 4th floor and walk through the second checkpoint "Time
              Tunnel" connecting to James Lee Science Building.

          <div class="checkpoint-section slide-in">
            <h3>Background Facts</h3>
            <p>
              This corridor connecting the 4th floor of Haking Wong Building to
              James Lee Science Building was once a common location for students
              to travel around the campus, but now less being used since the MTR
              station provided alternative routes.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="checkpoint-section slide-in">
            <h3>The Legend</h3>
            <p>
              A student walking through this corridor after 10 p.m. tapped a
              figure facing a locker, assuming it was a classmate. Upon turning,
              the student realized the figure was not a classmate, but the
              student's own reflection. Therefore, the corridor is named "Time
              Tunnel," as the student travels through time encountering their
              past self.
            </p>

          <div class="checkpoint-section slide-in">
            <h3>Modern Interpretation</h3>
            <p>
              This legend might be created due to the corridor layout looking
              similar to the human imagination of a time tunnel, with its long,
              narrow shape, bright lights coming from the end, and the way it
              seems to stretch on forever.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              This legend reflects the time flies feeling of university life, as
              students often feel like they are racing against the clock, trying
              to balance their studies, social lives, and personal growth.
              Tapping its own reflection symbolizes current students reminiscing
              about their past selves, highlighting the rapid passage of time;
              the failure to recognize themselves reflects the changes they have
              undergone.

              elevators, it houses the Faculty of Architecture. Its complex

                An old key-keeper who committed suicide because of losing a key,
                now patrols asking students: "Have you seen my key?" Those who
                ignore him find themselves followed until they offer any key.
              </li>
              <li>
                A student gave his own home key to the old key-keeper but days
                after, the old key-keeper returned it, saying "This isn't my
                key. Where is mine?"
              </li>
              <li>
                One student found the old man inside his locker after giving him
                his own locker key.
              </li>
              <li>
                Architecture freshmen were given wooden spoons to offer the
                key-keeper if approached during Architecture Society
                orientation.

              major students and keys symbolize access, responsibility, and the

              The bridge connects Knowles Building's 5th floor to the old Main
              Library wing. However, it is rarely used by students today.

            <h3>The Legend</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A student, devastated by failing a test, allegedly jumped off
                the roof of the Knowles Building. Her body fell into Happy Park
                after her head was cut off by an open bridge window. Late-night
                observers claim to have seen a female head floating near the
                bridge window.
              </li>
              <li>
                Her bloodstain remained on the bridge floor after her death, and
                the cleaning crew was unable to get rid of it, thus the interior
                of the bridge was painted red.
              </li>
              <li>
                After the incident, the bridge was sealed off with Taoist Fu
                (charms) on both sides.

            <h3>Modern Interpretation</h3>
            <p>
              This Legend derives from academic stress and mental health
              struggles of students, especially when this Legend located between
              the home of Architecture students and the old Main Library wing,
              both gathering places for students facing high academic pressures.

            <p>
              As HKU's historic core, this building is the oldest building in
              HKU, completed in 1912. After the Faculty of Arts moved to
              Centennial Campus in 2012, it was refurbished into classrooms and
              offices.

                The dragon door handle of Loke Yew Hall is said to prevent

                Architectural patterns like the number of staircases and room

            <h3>Modern Interpretation</h3>
            <p>
              These "luck-based" rituals embody graduation anxiety, creating
              tangible rules that help students navigate academic uncertainties
              through shared superstitions. Additionally, the main building's
              long history and contrasting architectural design against modern
              campus buildings make it a fitting site for legends blending
              tradition and student folklore.
