          <h2>Tour Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to "HKU's Spectral Circuit," a 1.5-hour walking tour that
            explores the thin line between fact and fiction at the University of
            Hong Kong. This journey through HKU's main campus reveals how urban
            legends emerge from specific historical contexts, reflect student
            anxieties, and become part of the university's living folklore.
            Designed specifically for freshmen, this tour helps you navigate
            both the physical landscape and the hidden stories of your new
            academic home.

          <h3>Background Facts</h3>
          <p>
            Before the HKU MTR station opened in 2014, this building served as a
            crucial gateway for students arriving by bus. The elevators provided
            access to the Haking Podium and connecting corridors to other campus
            buildings.

            <li>
              A student riding alone at midnight found the elevator stopping
              between floors, revealing the word "DEAD" scrawled in blood-red on
              the elevator shaft
            </li>
            <li>
              Another student asked a figure outside, "Do you want to come in?"
              only to receive the reply: "The lift is full. How can I get in?"
            </li>
            <li>
              A third encountered four figures standing in the corners, all with
              their backs turned
            </li>

          <p>
            These stories likely emerged from the stress of late-night studying
            and the eerie atmosphere of empty campus spaces, transforming
            functional elevators into vessels for collective student anxiety.

            This corridor connecting the 4th floor of Haking Wong Building to

            After 10 p.m., a student tapped a figure facing a locker, assuming
            it was a classmate. Upon turning, the person realized they were
            looking at their own reflection.

            university's founding patrons. After the Faculty of Arts moved to
            Centennial Campus in 2012, it was refurbished into classrooms and
            offices.
